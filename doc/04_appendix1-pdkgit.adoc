= Cloning and Developing PDK

[NOTE]
This section is only for pdk developers.
If you are only interested in writing a BIS specification you don't need
to read on.

== Install PDK

To use pdk you have to install and configure the following SDKs/libraries.

- https://www.jruby.org/getting-started[jruby]

- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html[java(8 or 11)]



== Installation Steps

. Clone/Download the pdk-utils repository
+
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenPEPPOL/pdk-utils.git
```
+
. Install dependencies
+
```bash
./init.sh
```
+
or
+
```bash
bundler install
```
+
. `source` the setup file from your interactive shell to setup the environment
+
.linux
[source,bash,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
$ source ./setup.sh
----
+
.windows
[source,bash,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
$ setup.bat
----
+
[source,bash,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.osx
[source,bash]
----
$ source ./setup_mac.sh
----
+
. Check installation
+
[source,bash]
----
$ which pdk
----
. Now you are ready to use pdk directly (without a docker image) on a bis project.

This is usally helpful when you are developing pdk and want to see the direct effects
on a sample project.
